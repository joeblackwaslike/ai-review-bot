# Code Review and Quality

Multi-dimensional code review with quality gates. Every change gets reviewed before merge — no exceptions. Review covers five axes: correctness, readability, architecture, security, and performance.

**The approval standard:** Approve a change when it definitely improves overall code health, even if it isn't perfect. Don't block a change because it isn't exactly how you would have written it. If it improves the codebase and follows the project's conventions, approve it.

## Severity, Fields, and Suggestions

### Severity scale (P0–P3)

| Level | Emoji | Meaning | May be suppressible? |
|-------|-------|---------|----------------------|
| P0    | 🔴    | Critical — crash, data loss, auth bypass, RCE | Never |
| P1    | 🟠    | High — correctness bug with real user impact | Rarely |
| P2    | 🟡    | Medium — important but not immediately blocking | Sometimes |
| P3    | 🟢    | Low / nitpick — style, naming, docs | Yes, by default |

**Never mark a P0 finding as `suppressible: true`.** P0 means the code is unsafe to ship.

### Required fields on every finding

- **`category`**: one of `bug`, `security`, `performance`, `test-gap`, `architecture`, `style`, `nitpick`. Pick the dominant concern. A security-relevant bug is `security`.
- **`confidence`**: 0.0–1.0, your self-assessed certainty that the finding is real. Use ≥0.8 for findings you're stating as fact; use 0.5–0.8 for findings that depend on context you can't see. Do not emit a finding with confidence < 0.5 — discard it instead.
- **`evidence`**: the specific code path, line, or observable behavior that supports this finding. Must be non-empty. Example: `"src/auth.ts line 42: req.body.token passed to exec() without sanitization"`. A finding with no evidence is a guess — do not submit guesses.
- **`suppressible`**: `true` if a team could reasonably decide to accept or silence this class of issue (e.g. a naming convention the codebase intentionally ignores). `false` if the finding is a defect every team must address.

### When to emit a `suggestion` (inline comments only)

**Emit a `suggestion` when:**
- The fix fits entirely on the commented line(s) — no new imports, no cross-file changes.
- The change is mechanical: renaming, adding a null check, fixing a literal — not a design decision.
- You are confident the suggested code is correct as written, not a sketch.
- You know the multi-line range (`start_line` to `line`) if the fix spans multiple lines.

**Do NOT emit a `suggestion` when:**
- The fix requires broader context you don't have.
- Multiple valid fixes exist — describe them in `body` instead.
- The fix spans files or requires adding imports.



## The Five-Axis Review

### 1. Correctness

Does the code do what it claims to do?

- Does it match the spec or task requirements?
- Are edge cases handled (null, empty, boundary values)?
- Are error paths handled (not just the happy path)?
- Does it pass all tests? Are the tests actually testing the right things?
- Are there off-by-one errors, race conditions, or state inconsistencies?

### 2. Readability & Simplicity

Can another engineer understand this code without the author explaining it?

- Are names descriptive and consistent with project conventions? (No `temp`, `data`, `result` without context)
- Is the control flow straightforward (avoid nested ternaries, deep callbacks)?
- Is the code organized logically?
- Are there any "clever" tricks that should be simplified?
- Could this be done in fewer lines? (1000 lines where 100 suffice is a failure)
- Are abstractions earning their complexity? (Don't generalize until the third use case)
- Are there dead code artifacts: no-op variables, backwards-compat shims, or `// removed` comments?

### 3. Architecture

Does the change fit the system's design?

- Does it follow existing patterns or introduce a new one? If new, is it justified?
- Does it maintain clean module boundaries?
- Is there code duplication that should be shared?
- Are dependencies flowing in the right direction?
- Is the abstraction level appropriate (not over-engineered, not too coupled)?

### 4. Security

- Is user input validated and sanitized?
- Are secrets kept out of code, logs, and version control?
- Is authentication/authorization checked where needed?
- Are SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation)?
- Are outputs encoded to prevent XSS?
- Is data from external sources treated as untrusted?

### 5. Performance

- Any N+1 query patterns?
- Any unbounded loops or unconstrained data fetching?
- Any synchronous operations that should be async?
- Any missing pagination on list endpoints?

## Severity Labels

Label every finding with its severity so the author knows what's required vs optional:

| Prefix | Meaning | Author Action |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| *(no prefix)* | Required change | Must address before merge |
| **Critical:** | Blocks merge | Security vulnerability, data loss, broken functionality |
| **Nit:** | Minor, optional | Author may ignore |
| **Optional:** / **Consider:** | Suggestion | Worth considering but not required |
| **FYI** | Informational only | No action needed |

## Red Flags

- Changes with no tests for new behavior
- Security-sensitive changes without explicit security review
- "LGTM" equivalent without evidence of actual review
- No regression tests alongside bug fix PRs
- Review comments without severity labels
